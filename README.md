üß© Project: End-to-End DevOps CI/CD Implementation on Azure Kubernetes Services(AKS) with Terraform, GitOps and Monitoring

üìò Overview

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps lifecycle on Microsoft Azure, showcasing automation and orchestration skills for modern cloud-native applications.

Base Application: Example Voting App by Docker Samples (open-source microservices demo).

Learning Foundation: Inspired by Abhishek Veeramalla's DevOps tutorials for core workflow understanding.

Infrastructure as Code: Terraform modules for Azure (RG, AKS, ACR) with remote state in Azure Storage

CI/CD Automation: Azure DevOps YAML pipelines for build, push to ACR, and manifest updates

GitOps Delivery: ArgoCD configuration for sync, health monitoring

Monitoring Setup: Prometheus and Grafana deployment with node/pod metrics (app metrics troubleshooting documented)

Operational Focus: This isn't just a deployment demo‚Äîit includes real troubleshooting scenarios and documented failure recovery, proving job-ready DevOps skills.

**My Contributions:** 

All infrastructure, automation, and operational work in this repository:

**Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**  
Terraform modules for Azure Resource Group, AKS Cluster, and ACR with remote state in Azure Storage.

**CI/CD Automation**  
Azure DevOps YAML pipelines for each microservice (Vote, Result, Worker) to build Docker images, push to ACR, and auto-deploy to AKS.

**GitOps Integration**  
ArgoCD implementation for continuous delivery with declarative Git-based deployment and manifest version control.

**Container Orchestration**  
Kubernetes manifests deployment for all services (Vote, Result, Worker, Redis, Postgres) on AKS.

**Observability & Monitoring**  
Prometheus Operator for metrics scraping and Grafana dashboards for cluster/container health visualization.

**Security & Access Control**  
Azure service principals, Docker registry secrets, and AKS RBAC configuration for secure deployments.

**Troubleshooting & Operations**  
Resolved image-pull issues, service exposure problems, and Prometheus scraping errors with documented solutions.

üß± Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](docs/screenshots/Project-workflow.PNG)

1. Infrastructure Layer

Terraform provisions:

Azure Resource Group

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster

Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Backend state securely stored in Azure Storage Account.


2. CI/CD Layer

Azure Pipelines automates:

Building Docker images for vote, result, and worker apps.

Pushing images to ACR.

Updating Kubernetes manifests with new image tags.

ArgoCD provides GitOps:

Continuously syncs manifests from GitHub to AKS.


3. Monitoring Layer

Prometheus and Grafana deployed on AKS for observability.

System-level metrics (node, pod, exporter) are successfully scraped and visualized.

Prometheus <-> vote app ‚Äúconnection refused‚Äù issue highlights pending configuration and service discovery adjustments.


üîÅ Workflow Summary

1. Developer commits code ‚Üí GitHub repository.

2. Azure Pipelines triggers build, pushes images to ACR.

3. Updated manifests committed ‚Üí ArgoCD detects and deploys to AKS.

4. Prometheus + Grafana monitor workloads in (partial) real time.

‚ùì FAQ

**Q: How do you detect configuration drift?**  
A: ArgoCD shows "OutOfSync" status with diff between desired (Git) and live (cluster) state.

**Q: How do you handle failed deployments?**  
A: Investigate with ArgoCD health/diff, check history, execute rollback, verify healthy state.

**Q: How are images tagged and promoted?**  
A: CI pipeline builds and tags images, pushes to ACR, updates manifests with new tags.

**Q: How is Terraform state secured?**  
A: Remote backend in Azure Storage Account with restricted access and state locking.

**Q: What's the monitoring status?**  
A: Node/pod metrics operational; app metrics pending (ServiceMonitor config + RBAC verification needed).


## üéØ Key Learning Outcomes

- **Real-world DevOps workflows:** Hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure-as-Code, and GitOps methodologies
- **Azure cloud expertise:** Practical knowledge of AKS, ACR, resource management, and service integration  
- **Production troubleshooting:** Debugging authentication, connectivity, and monitoring issues typical in enterprise environments
- **Operational mindset:** Focus on stability, rollback procedures, and documentation for maintainable systems


üß© Future Enhancements


1. Fix Prometheus ‚Äúconnection refused‚Äù for application metrics.

2. Implement Prometheus Alertmanager for automated alerts.

3. Extend Grafana dashboards for app-level performance metrics.
